# Setup

To get started with QIRT, you'll need to install it on your system. This tutorial will guide you through the installation process.

## Prerequisites

QIRT requires Python 3.10 or later. Make sure you have a compatible version of Python installed on your system.

## Installing QIRT

You can install QIRT using pip, Python's package installer. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install QIRT
```

This command will download and install QIRT along with its dependencies.

## Setting up a Jupyter Notebook Environment

QIRT requires a Jupyter Notebook compatible environment for result visualization. We recommend using Jupyter Notebook for the best interactive experience with QIRT.

Here's how to set it up:

1. Install Jupyter:

    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Create a new notebook and you're ready to start!

!!! note

    While we recommend Jupyter Notebook for beginners, QIRT can also be used in other Jupyter Notebook compatible environments, such as Google Colab or IDEs with Jupyter support. Choose the option that best suits your development preferences and workflow.

## Next Steps
